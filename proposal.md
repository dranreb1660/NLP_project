#  NLP Project: - Automating FAQ Response for bank

### Abstract:
We hear a lot about Chatbots these days, chatbots are the solution for consumer frustration regarding customer care call assistance. They provide modern-day virtual assistance for simple problems of the customer and offload low-priority, high turnover tasks which require no skill. In this project, I will use natural language processing to automate a bank customer response in an a frequently asked section be means of semantically understunding the the querry, and returning the best possible answer 


### Data Description
* We will use a public dataset by HDFC bank and can be lecated [here on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/abbbhishekkk/faq-datasets-for-chatbot-training?select=HDFC_Faq.txt)
* The data contains over 2000 real customer questions, and each question is associated with a profesion response from the bank associate. 



### Algorithm
* I will apply various topic modeling approaches to explain and understand the data
* I will use dimensionlity reduction approaches to reduce the high dimensional features to a fairely interpretable dimention for both interpretability and predictability
* I will use semantic similarity to find the closest question to a customer's querry to return the best posible comparable answer to the querry

### Tools/ Libraries:
* Python  
* pandas
* SQL/sqlalchemy
* Scikit-learn
* NLTK
* Gensim



### MVP 
* explore on some preliminary Dimensionality reduction
* Build a basic auto answer generator using semantic similarity and dimensionality reduction techniques
